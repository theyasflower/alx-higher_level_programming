##### first question what is the difference between javascript and node.js

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that was initially designed to run in web browsers. It is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language that is used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.

Node.js (Node) is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, on the server-side. Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome, to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser.

Overall, JavaScript and Node.js share the same syntax and many of the same features, but they are designed for different environments and use cases.
