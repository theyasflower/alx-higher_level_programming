## Python Networking 0
Python is a powerful language for networking and can be used to create a wide variety of network applications. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, Python can be a great language to learn for networking.

### Introduction to Networking
Networking is the practice of connecting two or more devices together so that they can communicate with each other. Networks can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as sharing files, accessing the internet, or running applications that require multiple devices to work together.

Python provides a number of built-in modules that can be used to work with networks, such as **socket**, **urllib**, and **http**. These modules allow you to create network connections, send and receive data, and perform other common networking tasks.

##### URL
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet and specify how to access that resource.

A URL typically consists of several parts, including:

1. Protocol: The protocol specifies the method to be used to access the resource. Examples of common protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS (HTTP Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SSH (Secure Shell).

2. Domain Name: The domain name identifies the server that hosts the resource. It consists of one or more parts separated by dots, such as "google.com" or "wikipedia.org".

3. Path: The path specifies the location of the resource on the server. It may include one or more directories and a filename, and is separated from the domain name by a forward slash ("/").

4. Query String: The query string provides additional information about the resource, such as parameters to be passed to a script. It is separated from the path by a question mark ("?") and consists of one or more key-value pairs separated by ampersands ("&")
For example, the following is a URL that points to the homepage of the Google search engine:
```css
https://www.google.com/
```
